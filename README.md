# EmoDiary
EmoDiary is a new customized way of diary entry.
It uses technologies like nlp , flask, sentiment analysis to predict emotion of the text. 
As per the diary entry's emotional tone, the color of the text area changes every 25 seconds.
New addition in this project are to be done by integrating the ASL, To make the diary entry more fun, stickers can be automatically added by showing sign language sings to the camera.
The model predicts the sign and convert it into text to pass it to API to get the stickers.
Then the stickers will be added to the diary either on thr background or as a transparent sticker.

The project aims just not to make a fun diary entry but also to understand the value of sign language
and provide a platform for engaged learning.
